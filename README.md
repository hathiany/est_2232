# STA 2232 - Ecological Samling Techniques 
## Purpose
To equip the student should be with modern ideas in sampling and estimating the size of biological populations
## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, the student should be able to:-
1. Define ecology.
2. Describe ecological sampling techniques
3. Describe quadrant sampling and point transect.
4. Describe capture and recapture methods
5. Describe catch effort
6. Describe indirect sampling methods
7. Estimate animal abundance

## Course Description
- Introductory ideas to ecological sampling.
- Quadrant sampling, distance sampling for line and point transect.
- Capture-recapture methods for closed populations.
- Extensions of capture-recapture methods: removal, catch effort and changes in ratio methods.
- Indirect sampling methods and estimation of animal abundance.
